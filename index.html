          <h2 class="section-heading">Hoisting</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Hoisting</strong>
            is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top
            of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means you can use variables and
            functions before you declare them in the code. However, only the declarations are
            hoisted, not the initializations.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Variables Declared with
            <code>var</code>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Variables declared with
            <code>var</code>
            are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. However, their initialization
            remains in place, which can lead to
            <code>undefined</code>
            values if accessed before initialization.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  console.log(myVar); // undefined
  var myVar = 5;
  console.log(myVar); // 5
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In the example above, the declaration of
            <code>myVar</code>
            is hoisted, but its initialization is not, resulting in
            <code>undefined</code>
            when accessed before the assignment.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Function Declarations</h3>
          <p>
            Function declarations are fully hoisted, meaning you can call the function before its
            declaration in the code.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  console.log(myFunction()); // "Hello, World!"

  function myFunction() {
    return "Hello, World!";
  }
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the function
            <code>myFunction</code>
            is hoisted, allowing it to be called before its declaration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>
            Variables Declared with
            <code>let</code>
            and
            <code>const</code>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Unlike
            <code>var</code>
            , variables declared with
            <code>let</code>
            and
            <code>const</code>
            are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a
            <code>ReferenceError</code>
            if accessed before their declaration.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  console.log(myLetVar); // ReferenceError
  let myLetVar = 10;
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example,
            <code>myLetVar</code>
            is hoisted but not initialized, resulting in a
            <code>ReferenceError</code>
            when accessed before its declaration.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding hoisting is essential for writing predictable and bug-free JavaScript
            code. It helps in understanding the order of execution and the scope of variables and
            functions.

        <!-- Temporal Dead Zone -->
        <article id="temporal-dead-zone">
          <h2 class="section-heading">Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</h2>
          <p>
            The
            <strong>Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)</strong>
            is a behavior in JavaScript that affects variables declared with
            <code>let</code>
            ,
            <code>const</code>
            , and
            <code>class</code>
            . It refers to the period between the start of a block and the point where the variable
            is declared and initialized.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this period, the variable is in a "dead zone" and cannot be accessed, leading to
            a
            <code>ReferenceError</code>
            if you try to use it. This behavior helps prevent errors and encourages better coding
            practices.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Variables Declared with
            <code>let</code>
            and
            <code>const</code>
          </h3>
          <p>
            Both
            <code>let</code>
            and
            <code>const</code>
            are block-scoped, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared
            in. They are hoisted to the top of their block, but they are not initialized until the
            declaration is encountered.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  {
    // TDZ starts
    console.log(myVar); // ReferenceError
    let myVar = 10; // TDZ ends
    console.log(myVar); // 10
  }
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In the example above,
            <code>myVar</code>
            is in the TDZ until the line where it is declared.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Classes</h3>
          <p>
            Similar to
            <code>let</code>
            and
            <code>const</code>
            ,
            <code>class</code>
            declarations are also hoisted but not initialized. Attempting to access a class before
            its declaration will result in a
            <code>ReferenceError</code>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  {
    // TDZ starts
    const obj = new MyClass(); // ReferenceError
    class MyClass {
      constructor() {
        this.name = 'Example';
      }
    }
    // TDZ ends
  }
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example,
            <code>MyClass</code>
            is in the TDZ until its declaration is encountered.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding the TDZ is crucial for avoiding common pitfalls when using
            <code>let</code>
            ,
            <code>const</code>
            , and
            <code>class</code>
            in JavaScript. It ensures that variables are not accessed before they are properly
            initialized.

        <!-- call stack -->
        <article id="callstack">
          <h2 class="section-heading">Call Stack</h2>
          <p>
            The
            <strong>call stack</strong>
            is a data structure that keeps track of function calls in a program. It operates in a
            <em>Last In, First Out</em>
            (LIFO) manner, meaning the last function added to the stack is the first one to be
            executed and removed. Here's how it works:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Function Invocation:</strong>
              When a function is called, a new execution context is created and pushed onto the call
              stack.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Execution:</strong>
              The function executes, and any functions it calls are added to the stack.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Completion:</strong>
              Once a function completes, its execution context is popped off the stack, and control
              returns to the previous context.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />
          <p>
            The call stack helps manage the order of function execution and is crucial for handling
            synchronous operations. If the stack grows too large (e.g., due to excessive recursion),
            it can lead to a
            <strong>stack overflow</strong>
            error.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Execution Context</h3>
          <p>
            An
            <strong>execution context</strong>
            is an environment where JavaScript code is evaluated and executed. There are three main
            types of execution contexts:
          </p>

          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Global Execution Context:</strong>
              This is the default context where code starts executing. It creates the global object
              (
              <code>window</code>
              in browsers) and sets up the global scope.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Function Execution Context:</strong>
              Each time a function is invoked, a new execution context is created for that function.
              It includes:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Variable Object (VO):</strong>
                  Contains function arguments, local variables, and function declarations.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scope Chain:</strong>
                  References the current variable object and its parent scopes, allowing access to
                  variables in outer scopes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>
                    <code>this</code>
                    Binding:
                  </strong>
                  Determines the value of
                  <code>this</code>
                  within the function.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>
              <strong>Eval Execution Context:</strong>
              Created when code is executed inside an
              <code>eval</code>
              function. It's less commonly used and generally discouraged due to security and
              performance concerns.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <br />
          <p>
            Execution contexts are created in two phases:
            <br />
            1. the creation phase (where the scope chain, variable object, and
            <code>this</code>
            <br />
            2. are set up) and the execution phase (where code is executed line by line).
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding the call stack and execution context helps in debugging, optimizing code,
            and understanding how JavaScript handles function calls and scope.

        <!-- Functions as First-Class-Citizens -->
        <article id="first-class-citizens">
          <h2 class="section-heading">Functions as First-Class Citizens</h2>
          <p>
            In JavaScript, functions are treated as
            <strong>first-class citizens</strong>
            . This means that functions can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other
            functions, and returned from other functions. This flexibility allows for powerful
            programming patterns and techniques.
          </p>
          <h3>Assigning Functions to Variables</h3>
          <p>
            Functions can be assigned to variables, allowing them to be stored and passed around
            like any other value.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  const greet = function(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  };

  console.log(greet("Alice")); // "Hello, Alice!"
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the function is assigned to the variable
            <code>greet</code>
            , which can then be used to call the function.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Passing Functions as Arguments</h3>
          <p>
            Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, enabling higher-order functions
            and callbacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function performOperation(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
  }

  const add = (x, y) => x + y;
  const result = performOperation(5, 3, add);

  console.log(result); // 8
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            Here, the
            <code>add</code>
            function is passed as an argument to
            <code>performOperation</code>
            , demonstrating how functions can be used as callbacks.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Returning Functions from Other Functions</h3>
          <p>
            Functions can also be returned from other functions, allowing for the creation of
            function factories and closures.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function createMultiplier(multiplier) {
    return function(number) {
      return number * multiplier;
    };
  }

  const double = createMultiplier(2);
  console.log(double(5)); // 10
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example,
            <code>createMultiplier</code>
            returns a new function that multiplies its input by a specified multiplier,
            demonstrating the use of closures.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding functions as first-class citizens is fundamental to leveraging
            JavaScript's functional programming capabilities, enabling more abstract and flexible
            code.
          </p>
        </article>

        <!-- Closures -->
        <article id="closures">
          <h2 class="section-heading">Closures</h2>
          <p>
            A
            <strong>closure</strong>
            is a feature in JavaScript where an inner function has access to its outer enclosing
            function's variables and parameters, even after the outer function has finished
            executing. Closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation
            time.
          </p>
          <h3>How Closures Work</h3>
          <p>
            Closures allow a function to access variables from an outer function's scope chain. This
            includes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Variables declared in the outer function's scope.</li>
            <li>Parameters of the outer function.</li>
            <li>Variables from the global scope.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function outerFunction(outerVariable) {
    return function innerFunction(innerVariable) {
      console.log('Outer Variable:', outerVariable);
      console.log('Inner Variable:', innerVariable);
    };
  }

  const newFunction = outerFunction('outside');
  newFunction('inside');
  // Output:
  // Outer Variable: outside
  // Inner Variable: inside
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example,
            <code>innerFunction</code>
            forms a closure that captures
            <code>outerVariable</code>
            from
            <code>outerFunction</code>
            's scope.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Use-Cases of Closures</h3>
          <h4>1. Data Privacy</h4>
          <p>
            Closures can be used to create private variables or methods. This is useful for
            encapsulating data and preventing it from being accessed directly from outside the
            function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function createCounter() {
    let count = 0;
    return {
      increment: function() {
        count++;
        return count;
      },
      decrement: function() {
        count--;
        return count;
      }
    };
  }

  const counter = createCounter();
  console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
  console.log(counter.decrement()); // 0
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            Here,
            <code>count</code>
            is a private variable that can only be modified through the
            <code>increment</code>
            and
            <code>decrement</code>
            methods.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>2. Function Factories</h4>
          <p>
            Closures can be used to create function factories, which generate functions with
            pre-configured settings or behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function createAdder(x) {
    return function(y) {
      return x + y;
    };
  }

  const addFive = createAdder(5);
  console.log(addFive(10)); // 15
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example,
            <code>createAdder</code>
            returns a new function that adds a specific number to its argument, demonstrating how
            closures can be used to configure functions.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h4>3. Maintaining State in Asynchronous Code</h4>
          <p>
            Closures are often used in asynchronous programming to maintain state across
            asynchronous operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Example:</strong>
          </p>
          <pre><code>
  function delayedGreeting(name) {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log('Hello, ' + name);
    }, 1000);
  }

  delayedGreeting('Alice');
  // After 1 second: "Hello, Alice"
  </code></pre>
          <p>
            Here, the closure allows the
            <code>setTimeout</code>
            callback to access the
            <code>name</code>
            variable even after
            <code>delayedGreeting</code>
            has finished executing.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Understanding closures is crucial for mastering JavaScript, as they enable powerful
            patterns and techniques for managing scope, state, and data privacy.
